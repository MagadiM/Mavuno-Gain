# Mavuno Gain

Mavuno Gain is a flutter project that aims to bring farmers and farm produce vendors together without the use of brokers in their dealings. The platform will allow farmers get access to the markets and vendors access to farmers hence making trading with the Agricultural sector much easier. 

## Login pages

## Main Dashboard
Once here farmers and vendors can login and check out their respective dashboards. At their dashboards they will be able to see current transaction, and past transactions. Further, farmers will be able to see their sales, and vendors who have reached out through their chat section. Vendors, on the other hand will have the chat option, and will see their transactions as well.
